Analysis code for doctoral thesis in Sociology

This repository contains the processing and analysis codes of the work planned to develop my doctoral thesis at the Institute of Sociology of the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.

Article 1 analyzes the formation of occupational "mobility classes" during the last two decades in Chile, following the definition made in (Cheng & Park, 2020). This article examines individual trajectories through social network analysis and sequence analysis techniques. Here, the occupational market structure is analyzed as an institutional structure that links at least 2 or 3 modes (or levels) (Knoke et al., 2021). One is the movement of individuals between occupations and classes, and the other is the relationships established between categories of occupations and emerging outcomes such as segregation, closure, and contagion.

Article 2 links the previous analysis with the historical changes and technological development that determine the disappearance and emergence of new occupations and new dynamics of closure and inequality.

Article 3: Agent-based model (under development).
